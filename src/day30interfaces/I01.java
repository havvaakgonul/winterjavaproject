/*
  1)"interface" is not a class.
  2)"interface" can contain just "abstract" methods
  	"abstract" classes can contain both "concrete" and abstract method
  3)"abstract class" is a class, but interface is not a class
  4)"interface" provides "fully abstraction" but "abstract classes" does not 
  
  5) Why do we need "interfaces" while we have "abstract classes"?
  	java does not support "multiple inheritance".It means a class cannot have multiple parents.
  	But sometimes we need multiple parents because of that Java created "interfaces"
  	
  6) When do we use "interfaces"?
  	a)When we need to create multiple parent for a class we use interfaces.
  	b)"interfaces" are "todo list", if you want a child class to do sth,
  	put them into an interface
  	
  	7)Concrete Class====> interface use "implements" keyword
  		Interface===> Interface use "extends" keyword
  		Interface===> Concrete Class is  impossible,
  		because a Concrete Class cannot be the of an interface
  		
  	8) When a concrete class has multiple parent interfaces, the parent interfaces may have methods whose signatures are same and return types are sameç
  	It is  allowed...
  	
  	NOTE: If you use different return types with same signature, it creates, problem, you will get compile time error.

	9)When you make an interface child of another interface, no need to override abstract methods
