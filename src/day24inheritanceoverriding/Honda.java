/*
 Using "@Override" annotation is not must to achieve "overriding" but
 it has 2 benefits; a)When you use "@Override" annotation, Java checks overriding
 					for you. If it is not correct, it gives you Compile Time Error
 					b)When you use "@Override" annotation, it is good for readability
 
 
 NOTE: "Private" methods cannot be overridden 
 NOTE: Access modifiers of "overriding methods" (Methods are in Child Class)
 should be wider than or equal to the access modifiers of "overridden methods" (Methods are in Parent Class)
 
 Note: If return type is "primitive" or "void" in overriding, you cannot touch to the return type
 
 Note: If return type is "non-primitive", you should have "IS-A" relationship
